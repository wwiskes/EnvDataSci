Time series data are widely used in the financial sector for obvious reasons, and 
these methods can be very useful environmental data science especially in studies
such as looking at long-term climate change variables such as the Mauna Loa CO~2~
data above, or at the much finer temporal scale, environmental data from data loggers such as eddy covariance
flux towers.

```{r fig.align = 'left', out.width = "75%", fig.cap = "Red Clover Valley eddy covariance flux tower installation", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "RCVfluxTower2.png"))
```
```{r fig.align = 'left', out.width = "75%", fig.cap = "Loney Meadow net ecosystem exchange (NEE) results", echo=F}

## Creation of time series (ts) data

A time series (ts) is created with the ts() function.

- the time unit can be anything
- observations must be a regularly spaced series
- time values are not normally included as a field in the ts

```{r message=F, warning=F}
library(tidyverse)
SFhighF <- c(58,61,62,63,64,67,67,68,71,70,64,58)
SFlowF  <- c(47,48,49,50,51,53,54,55,56,55,51,47)
SFhighC <- (SFhighF-32)*5/9
SFlowC  <- (SFlowF-32)*5/9
SFtempC <- bind_cols(high=SFhighC,low=SFlowC)
plot(SFtempC);                  plot(ts(SFtempC))

```

### frequency setting

Frequency setting is a key parameter for ts()

- sets how many observations per time unit
- ts() mostly doesn't seem to care what the time unit is, however some functions figure it out, at least for an annual time unit, e.g. that 1-12 means months when there's a frequency of 12

```{r message=F, warning=F}
plot(ts(SFtempC, frequency=1), main="monthly time unit")
plot(ts(SFtempC, frequency=12), main="yearly time unit")

```

**frequency < 1**

If you have data of lower frequency than 1 per unit

- e.g. greenhouse gas data values every 20 years, starting in year 20, frequency 1/20 = 0.05

```{r warning=F, message=F}
library(dslabs)
data("greenhouse_gases")
GHGwide <- pivot_wider(greenhouse_gases, names_from = gas, 
                       values_from = concentration)
GHG <- ts(GHGwide, frequency=0.05, start=20) 
plot(GHG)

```

-- greenhouse gas data from @irizarry2019introduction

**start and end parameters**

- the time of the first (start) and last (end) observations. Either a single number or a vector of two numbers (the second of which is an integer), which specify a natural time unit and a (1-based) number of samples into the time unit.
- Example with year as the time unit and monthly data, starting July 2019 and ending June 2020:

`frequency=12, start=c(2019,7), end=c(2020,6)`

### Data logger data from Marble Mountains resurgence

[**`Marbles`**]

For a study of chemical water quality and hydrology of a karst system in the Marble Mountains of California, 
a spring *resurgence* was instrumented to measure water level, temperature, and specific conductance (a surrogate for total dissolved solids) over a 4-year period [@marbles].

```{r out.width = "75%", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "resurgenceStageRecorder.png"))
```

```{r fig.cap = "Marble Mountains resurgence data logger design", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "ResurgenceDataLogger.png"))
```

```{r out.width = "50%", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "instrumentationPicture.png"))
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "instrumentationLower.png"))
```

```{r message=F, warning=F}
library(tidyverse); library(lubridate)
resurg <- read_csv(system.file("extdata","resurgenceData.csv",package="iGIScData")) %>%
  mutate(date_time = mdy_hms(paste(date, time))) %>%
  dplyr::select(date_time, ATemp, BTemp, wlevelm, EC, InputV)
resurgTS <- ts(resurg, frequency = 12*365, start = c(1994, 266*12+7))
plot(resurgTS)
```


## Data smoothing methods

### moving average (ma)

- Simple generalization of sequential data
- The order parameter is how many values are averaged in the moving window
   - should be an odd number
   
```{r message=F, warning=F}
library(forecast)
ts(SFtempC, frequency=12)
ma(ts(SFtempC,frequency=12),order=3)
```

**moving average of CO2 data**

Difference shows time-local fluctuations, a component of the data, from @irizarry2019introduction.

```{r message=F, warning=F}
library(dslabs)
data("greenhouse_gases")
GHGwide <- pivot_wider(greenhouse_gases, 
           names_from = gas, 
           values_from = concentration)
CO2 <- ts(GHGwide$CO2,
          frequency = 0.05)
library(forecast)
CO2ma <- ma(CO2, order=7)
plot(CO2)
plot(CO2ma)
plot(CO2-CO2ma)
```

## Decomposing time series

: separating a time series into its constituent components. 

- original data
- trend component, removes seasonal and remainder
- if seasonal, also a seasonal component. Note that **season** relates to the time unit. If 1 year, "seasonality" refers to the
normal usage of seasons over a year. But if 1 day, seasons refers to different parts of a day, etc.
- irregular "random" remainder (time-local variation)

There are two common decomposition methods, the classic method `decompose` using moving averages, which we'll look
at first, then the "loess" method used by `stl`.

**Mauna Loa CO~2~ data with seasonality**

A good place to see the effect of seasonality is to look at the Mauna Loa CO~2~ data, which shows regular annual cycles, yet with
a regularly increasing trend over the years. The decomposition shows the original observations, followed by a trend line that removes the seasonal and local (short-term) random irregularities, a detrended *seasonal* picture which removes that trend to just show the seasonal cycles, followed by the random irregularities. Note the vertical scale: the units are all the same -- parts per million -- so the actual amplitude of the seasonal cycle should be the same as the annual amplitude of the observations, it's just scaled to the chart height, which tends to exaggerate the seasonal cycles and random irregularities. 

```{r message=F, warning=F, fig.cap="Decomposition of Mauna Loa monthly co2 time series (in base) extending from 1959 to 1981"}
plot(decompose(co2))
```

**Seasonal decomposition using loess**

The `stl` function stands for "Seasonal decomposition of Time series by Loess".  
Loess is a smoothing algorithm, that wor. If s.window = "periodic" the mean is used for smoothing;
the seasonal values are removed and the remainder smoothed to find the trend. 


```{r message=F, warning=F}
plot(stl(co2, s.window="periodic"))

```

**Marble Mountains karst resurgence study**

[**`Marbles`**]

In the Marble Mountains karst resurgence study [@marbles], water level water level has an annual seasonality
that might be best understand by decomposition.


```{r message=F, warning=F}
library(tidyverse); library(lubridate)
resurg <- read_csv(system.file("extdata","resurgenceData.csv",package="iGIScData")) %>%
  mutate(date_time = mdy_hms(paste(date, time))) %>%
  dplyr::select(date_time, ATemp, BTemp, wlevelm, EC, InputV)
wlevelm <- ts(resurg$wlevelm, frequency = 12*365, 
              start = c(1994, 266*12+7))
fit <- stl(wlevelm, s.window="periodic")
plot(fit)
```

### lag regression

We'll explore solar radiation and temperature data for Bugac, Hungary, and Manaus, Brazil, maintained by the European Fluxes Database [@icos].  (Create a **`SolarRad_Temp`** project for this.)

```{r warning=F, message=F}
library(readxl)
BugacSolstice <- read_xls(system.file("extdata", "SolarRad_Temp.xls", package="iGIScData"), 
                          sheet="BugacHungary", col_types = "numeric") %>%
  filter(Year != "YYYY" & `Day of Yr` < 177 & `Day of Yr` > 168) %>%
  dplyr::select(SolarRad, Tair)
BugacSolsticeTS <- ts(BugacSolstice, frequency = 48)
plot(BugacSolstice, main="a simple scatter plot that illustrates hysteresis"); plot(BugacSolsticeTS)
mod <- function(i) {sqrt(sum(lm(Tair~lag(SolarRad,i), data=BugacSolsticeTS)$resid**2))}
for(i in 0:5){print(paste(i,":",mod(i),sep=""))}
SolarRad_comp <- decompose(ts(BugacSolstice$SolarRad, frequency = 48))
Tair_comp <- decompose(ts(BugacSolstice$Tair, frequency = 48))
seasonals <- bind_cols(Rad = SolarRad_comp$seasonal, Temp = Tair_comp$seasonal)
ggplot(seasonals) + 
  geom_line(aes(x=seq_along(Rad), y=Rad/50), col="red", size=1) + 
  geom_line(aes(x=seq_along(Temp), y=Temp), col="darkgreen",size=1) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,480,12))
which.max(seasonals$Rad)
which.max(seasonals$Temp)
```

```{r warning=F, message=F}
library(readxl)
ManausSolstice <- read_xls(system.file("extdata", "SolarRad_Temp.xls", package="iGIScData"), 
                          sheet="ManausBrazil", col_types = "numeric") %>%
  filter(Year != "YYYY" & `Day of Yr` < 177 & `Day of Yr` > 168) %>%
  dplyr::select(SolarRad, Tair)
ManausSolsticeTS <- ts(ManausSolstice, frequency = 48)
plot(ManausSolstice, main="Manaus Brazil"); plot(ManausSolsticeTS)
mod <- function(i) {sqrt(sum(lm(Tair~lag(SolarRad,i), data=ManausSolsticeTS)$resid**2))}
for(i in 0:5){print(paste(i,":",mod(i),sep=""))}
SolarRad_comp <- decompose(ts(ManausSolstice$SolarRad, frequency = 48))
Tair_comp <- decompose(ts(ManausSolstice$Tair, frequency = 48))
seasonals <- bind_cols(Rad = SolarRad_comp$seasonal, Temp = Tair_comp$seasonal)
ggplot(seasonals) + 
  geom_line(aes(x=seq_along(Rad), y=Rad/50), col="red", size=1) + 
  geom_line(aes(x=seq_along(Temp), y=Temp), col="darkgreen",size=1) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,480,12))
which.max(seasonals$Rad)
which.max(seasonals$Temp)
```

### Ensemble Average

For any time series data with meaningful time units like days or years (or even weeks
when the data varies by days of the week -- this was the case with COVID-19 data), 
ensemble averages are a good way to visualize changes in a variable over that time unit.

As you could see from the decomposition and sequential graphics we created for the Bugac and Manaus
solar radiation and temperature data, looking at what happens over one day as an "ensemble" of
all of the days -- where the mean value is displayed along with error bars based on 
standard deviations of the distribution -- might be a useful figure.

```{r message=F, warning=F}
library(cowplot)
Manaus <- read_xls(system.file("extdata","SolarRad_Temp.xls",package="iGIScData"), 
                   sheet="ManausBrazil", col_types = "numeric") %>%
  dplyr::select(Year:Tair) %>% filter(Year != "YYYY")
ManausSum <- Manaus %>% group_by(Hr) %>% 
  summarize(meanRad = mean(SolarRad), meanTemp = mean(Tair),
            sdRad = sd(SolarRad), sdTemp = sd(Tair))
px <- ManausSum %>% ggplot(aes(x=Hr)) + scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,24,3))
p1 <- px + geom_line(aes(y=meanRad), col="blue") + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymax = meanRad + sdRad, ymin = meanRad - sdRad)) +
  ggtitle("Manaus 2005 ensemble solar radiation")
p2 <- px + geom_line(aes(y=meanTemp),col="red") + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymax=meanTemp+sdTemp, ymin=meanTemp-sdTemp)) +
  ggtitle("Manaus 2005 ensemble air temperature")
plot_grid(plotlist=list(p1,p2), ncol=1, align='v') # from cowplot

Bugac <- read_xls(system.file("extdata","SolarRad_Temp.xls",package="iGIScData"), 
                   sheet="BugacHungary", col_types = "numeric") %>%
  dplyr::select(Year:Tair) %>% filter(Year != "YYYY")
BugacSum <- Bugac %>% group_by(Hr) %>% 
  summarize(meanRad = mean(SolarRad), meanTemp = mean(Tair),
            sdRad = sd(SolarRad), sdTemp = sd(Tair))
px <- BugacSum %>% ggplot(aes(x=Hr)) + scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,24,3))
p1 <- px + geom_line(aes(y=meanRad), col="blue") + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymax = meanRad + sdRad, ymin = meanRad - sdRad)) +
  ggtitle("Bugac 2005 ensemble solar radiation")
p2 <- px + geom_line(aes(y=meanTemp),col="red") + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymax=meanTemp+sdTemp, ymin=meanTemp-sdTemp)) +
  ggtitle("Bugac 2005 ensemble air temperature")
plot_grid(plotlist=list(p1,p2), ncol=1, align='v') # from cowplot

```

### Julian Dates

Julian dates are the number of days since some start date

- The origin (Julian date 0) can be arbitrary
- Default for julian() is 1970-01-01

For climatological work where the year is very important, it usually means the number of days of any given year

- lubridate's yday() gives you this.
- same thing as setting the origin for julian() as the 12-31 of the previous year.
- Useful in time series when the year is the time unit and observations are by days of the year (e.g. for climate data)



```{R warning = F, message=F}
library(lubridate)
julian(ymd("2020-01-01"))
julian(ymd("1970-01-01"))
yday(ymd("2020-01-01"))
julian(ymd("2020-01-01"), origin=ymd("2019-12-31"))
```

To create a decimal yday including fractional days, here's a function:

```
ydayDec <- function(d) {
           yday(d)-1 + hour(d)/24 + minute(d)/1440 + second(d)/86400}
```
