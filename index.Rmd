# Prerequisites {-#chapter00.chapter_section .intro_section}

This book is intended to work in concert with a series of lectures and discussions among the participants in Geog 604/704 Environmental Data Science at San Francisco State University.  Data packages will be created on GitHub.

## Packages to install

Participants need to have R and RStudio installed, and at least the following packages:

- tidyverse (to include ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, stringr, etc.)
    - ggplot2
    - dplyr
    - stringr
    - tidyr
- lubridate
- sf
- raster
- tmap

To install these packages, the following code will work:

```
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "lubridate", "sf", "raster", "tmap"))
```

You can always add more packages as needed, do them one at a time, whatever. But 
generally *don't reinstall the packages again with the unless you actually want to reinstall it*, maybe because it's been updated. So generally I don't include `install.packages()` in my script. Once installed, you can access the packages with the library function, e.g.

```{r message=F}
library(tidyverse)
```

which you *will* want to include in your script.
 
## Data

We'll be using data from various sources, including data on CRAN like the code packages 
above which you install the same way -- so use `install.packages("palmerpenguins")`. 

We've also created a repository on GitHub that includes data we've developed in the iGISc at SFSU, and you'll need to install that package a slightly different way.

GitHub packages require a bit more work on 
the user's part since we need to first install `remotes` then use that to install the GitHub data package:

```
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("iGISc/iGIScData")
```

Note: you can also use `devtools` instead of `remotes` if you have that installed. They do the same thing; `remotes` is a subset of `devtools`. If you see a message about Rtools, you can ignore it since that is only needed for building tools from C++ and things like that.

Then you can access it just like other built-in data by including:

```{r message=F}
library(iGIScData)
```

To see what's in it, you'll see the various datasets listed in:

```
data(package="iGIScData")
```

Those package datasets can be used directly as sf data (if the sf library is installed) or data frames (all tibbles).  Raw data can also be read from the `extdata` folder that is installed on your computer when you install the package, using code such as:

```
csvPath <- system.file("extdata","TRI_1987_BaySites.csv", package="iGIScData")
TRI87 <- read_csv(csvPath)
```

or something similar for shapefiles.
