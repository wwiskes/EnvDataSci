# Prerequisites

This book is intended to work in concert with a series of lectures and discussions among the participants in Geog 604/704 Environmental Data Science at San Francisco State University.  Data packages will be created on GitHub.

Currently (March-April 2021) four chapters of the book are initially being used in will be used in Geog 9031 Introduction to R in the GIS Certificate Program.

Participants need to have R and RStudio installed, and at least the following packages:

- tidyverse (to include ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, stringr, etc.)
    - ggplot2
    - dplyr
    - stringr
    - tidyr
- lubridate
- palmerpenguins
- sf
- raster
- tmap

## Data
We'll be using data from various sources, but one repository that includes data we've developed in the iGISc at SFSU is stored on GitHub and you'll need to install that package. GitHub packages require a bit more work on 
the user's part since we need to first install `devtools` then use that to install the GitHub data package:

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("iGISc/iGIScData")
```
You may also need the rlang package installed. If you see a message about Rtools, you can ignore
it since that is only needed for building tools from C++ and things like that.

Then you can access it just like other built-in data by including:

```{r}
library(iGIScData)

```

To see what's in it, you'll see the various datasets listed in:

```{r}
data()
```
