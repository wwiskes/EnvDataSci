description: "Background, concepts and exercises for using R for environmental data science.  The focus is on applying the R language and various libraries for data manipulation, data analysis, time series, modeling, and spatial data/mapping. The output format for this example is bookdown::gitbook.  Book is under development, and currently just has five chapters, including this prerequisite chapter."

# Prerequisites

This book is intended to work in concert with a series of lectures and discussions among the participants in Geog 604/704 Environmental Data Science at San Francisco State University.  Data packages will be created on GitHub.


Participants need to have R and RStudio installed, and at least the following packages:

- tidyverse (to include ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, stringr, etc.)
    - ggplot2
    - dplyr
    - stringr
    - tidyr
- lubridate
- palmerpenguins
- sf
- raster
- tmap

## Data
We'll be using data from various sources, but one repository that includes data we've developed in the iGISc at SFSU is stored on GitHub and you'll need to install that package. GitHub packages require a bit more work on 
the user's part since we need to first install `remotes` then use that to install the GitHub data package:

```
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("iGISc/iGIScData")
```

Note: you can also use `devtools` instead of `remotes` if you have that installed. They do the same thing; `remotes` is a subset of `devtools`. If you see a message about Rtools, you can ignore it since that is only needed for building tools from C++ and things like that.

Then you can access it just like other built-in data by including:

```{r}
library(iGIScData)

```

To see what's in it, you'll see the various datasets listed in:

```{r}
data(package="iGIScData")
```

Those package datasets can be used directly as sf data (if the sf library is installed) or data frames (all tibbles).  Raw data can also be read from the `extdata` folder
that is installed on your computer when you install the package, using code such as:

```
csvPath <- system.file("extdata","TRI_1987_BaySites.csv", package="iGIScData")
TRI87 <- read_csv(csvPath)
```

or something similar for shapefiles.
