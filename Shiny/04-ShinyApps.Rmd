Shiny input widgets and outputs can be built into a Shiny app that can
be hosted on the web. We can see what these look like as embedded or inline
Shiny apps.  

To learn more about Shiny apps, see [Interactive Documents](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_shiny.html).

## Embedded Application

Here's an entire Shiny application embedded within our R Markdown document using the `shinyAppDir` function:

```{r sierra}
shinyAppDir(
  "apps/sierra",
  options = list(
    width = "100%", height = 700
  )
)
```
