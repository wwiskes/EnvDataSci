```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

A Shiny App project folder can also be stored in the `extdata` folder (or probably
another folder) of a data package. Here's the same `sierra` app accessed this way:
We'll use the `system.file` to find the path to the folder where the app is stored and
provide it to `shinyAppDir`:

```{r sierra}
library(iGIScData)
shinyAppDir(
  system.file("extdata","sierra",package="iGIScData"),
  options = list(
    width = "100%", height = 700
  )
)
```

[I'm not sure if this is useful, but maybe it means you just need to provide
this simple code to provide access to a chapter about Shiny apps?]
