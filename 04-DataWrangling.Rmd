# Data Wrangling in the tidyverse

The goals of this section are to continue where we started in the earlier chapter on data manipulation with **`dplyr`**, taking it further to let us restructure our data with **`tidyr`**, including the use of pivot tables, as well as string methods in **`stringr`**, dates & times processing with **`lubridate`**, and **`dplyr`** methods for joining data, doing set operations and binding data frame sections together.
