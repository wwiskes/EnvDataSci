[["index.html", "1 Prerequisites 1.1 Packages to install 1.2 Data", " 1 Prerequisites This book is intended to work in concert with a series of lectures and discussions among the participants in Geog 604/704 Environmental Data Science at San Francisco State University. Data packages will be created on GitHub. 1.1 Packages to install Participants need to have R and RStudio installed, and at least the following packages: tidyverse (to include ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, stringr, etc.) ggplot2 dplyr stringr tidyr lubridate sf raster tmap To install these packages, the following code will work: install.packages(c(&quot;tidyverse&quot;, &quot;lubridate&quot;, &quot;sf&quot;, &quot;raster&quot;, &quot;tmap&quot;)) You can always add more packages as needed, do them one at a time, whatever. But generally dont reinstall the packages again with the unless you actually want to reinstall it, maybe because its been updated. So generally I dont include install.packages() in my script. Once installed, you can access the packages with the library function, e.g. library(tidyverse) which you will want to include in your script. 1.2 Data Well be using data from various sources, including data on CRAN like the code packages above which you install the same way  so use install.packages(\"palmerpenguins\"). Weve also created a repository on GitHub that includes data weve developed in the iGISc at SFSU, and youll need to install that package a slightly different way. GitHub packages require a bit more work on the users part since we need to first install remotes then use that to install the GitHub data package: install.packages(&quot;remotes&quot;) remotes::install_github(&quot;iGISc/iGIScData&quot;) Note: you can also use devtools instead of remotes if you have that installed. They do the same thing; remotes is a subset of devtools. If you see a message about Rtools, you can ignore it since that is only needed for building tools from C++ and things like that. Then you can access it just like other built-in data by including: library(iGIScData) To see whats in it, youll see the various datasets listed in: data(package=&quot;iGIScData&quot;) Those package datasets can be used directly as sf data (if the sf library is installed) or data frames (all tibbles). Raw data can also be read from the extdata folder that is installed on your computer when you install the package, using code such as: csvPath &lt;- system.file(&quot;extdata&quot;,&quot;TRI_1987_BaySites.csv&quot;, package=&quot;iGIScData&quot;) TRI87 &lt;- read_csv(csvPath) or something similar for shapefiles.
